🛠 Design Requirements & Principles
DR1 – Event Discovery (Henri)

    Principles:

        Time-window focus: default view shows events for the next 7 days

        Chronological sorting by date and time

        Progressive information disclosure: week → day list → event card → detail view

    Heuristics: Visibility of system status, recognition over recall, flexibility & efficiency

    Theory: Cognitive Load Theory, Gestalt principles (prägnanz), Boroditsky’s mental time models
